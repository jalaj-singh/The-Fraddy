# The-Fraddy
Fraddy is a Python Module which is able to perform task like Chatbot, Assistant etc. It provides the basic functionality for any assistant application. This Fraddy is built using Python, Pytorch, and other open-source libraries and frameworks.  This project is created for those, who want to make, heavy tasks easier in their day-to-day life. Generally, it took lots of time to write code from scratch to build Virtual Assistant. So, we have used pre-installed libraries, which gives you easy functionality to build your own Virtual Assistant.

## Problem Statement
In our daily busy schedule, we forget to call or drop a text to our favorite ones. Let's make their life easier by introducing our project called “theFraddy”. 
No matter how busy you’re, just wake up Fraddy, tell him to perform a task for you and it will execute your command within a second. You’ll not just able to make call or drop messages, but can also send email, ask to book your flight, or appointment, or just to entertain your mood by some random jokes.

## Purpose-
This Program aims at developing a personal assistant for windows-based systems. The main purpose of the software is to perform the tasks of the user at certain commands, provided in either of the ways, speech or text. It will ease most of the work of the user as a complete task can be done on a single command. Fraddy draws its inspiration from Virtual assistants like Google Assistant for Android, Siri for iOS etc. Users can interact with the assistant either through voice commands or keyboard input.

## Scope
>Fraddy can be used in Railway stations, Airports, Government agencies, Research Organizations, Hospitals, Hotels, Colleges and the most importantly at Home by each member for different purposes.
>Presently, Fraddy is being developed as an automation tool and virtual assistant. Among the Various roles played by Fraddy are: 
- Search Engine with voice interactions 
- Tells a random joke
- Tells your IP address with detail
- Plays music and send emails
- Answer any question
>*** There shall be proper Documentation available on its Official GitHub repository for making further development easy, we aim to release our virtual assistant as an Open-Source Software where modifications and contributions by the community are warmly welcomed.***
